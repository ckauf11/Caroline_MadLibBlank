Mike is *blurry because it is gameday! He started *jump with friends and family at the Tailgate. They were all wearing *spoons for the game. As the game approached Mike *eat towards the stadium. He gets in the stadium and buys a *zebra. Mike finds his seat and is *slippery for the game to start. Mike loves the Tigers because they are so *brown. They are playing the *Japan *shoes. Obviously the Tigers win, and Mike *breathing *adorably!
